# preact-shader-player

This repo contains a very simple shader player built with Preact.

Used nano-create-app to create the project. [https://github.com/abhisheksoni27/nano-preact-app]

All the source files are in `src`.

# Usage

Inside a template project created with [nano-creat-app](), you can use the following scripts:

1. `npm start`: Parcel will start a develpment server at [localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234).

2. `npm run build`: Parcel will build your project, ready to be deployed.

# Development

Go ahead, fork and make your awesome changes and submit a Pull Request. I `await` your shenanigans. :laughing:.
